## Competitor Analysis

### 1. Plex MES (Manufacturing Execution System)

**Company**: Rockwell Automation
**Type**: Enterprise-grade, cloud-based MES

#### Onboarding Approach
- **Sales-driven**: Plex MES requires enterprise sales engagement
- **No self-service signup**: Not SaaS self-serve; requires consultation
- **Implementation-heavy**: Professional services team handles setup

#### Key Takeaway
Plex targets large manufacturers with complex needs. No quick-start wizard found - implementation is consultative and customized per client.

**Our Advantage**: We can offer self-service onboarding for SMBs who can't afford Plex's enterprise approach.

## Cross-Competitor Patterns

### 1. Implementation Timelines
| Platform | Min Timeline | Max Timeline | Target Audience |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Plex MES | Unknown | Enterprise consulting | Large manufacturers |
| Logiwa WMS | 2 weeks | 4 weeks | 3PLs, high-volume |
| NetSuite WMS | 2 weeks (fast-track) | 12 weeks | Enterprise |
| Fishbowl | Immediate (wizard) | Depends on complexity | SMBs |
| Odoo | Configuration-driven | Modular rollout | SMBs to mid-market |

**Trend**: Move toward faster self-service for SMBs, consultative for enterprise.

### 2. Onboarding Styles

**Sales-Driven (Enterprise)**:
- Plex MES: Full professional services
- NetSuite WMS: Implementation partner-led

**Self-Service (SMB)**:
- Fishbowl: Simple 3-step wizard
- Logiwa: 3-4 hour training for staff
- Odoo: In-app guided tours

**Hybrid**:
- NetSuite: Now offering 30-minute self-service
- Logiwa: Dedicated onboarding team + intuitive UI

### 3. Role-Based Dashboards

**Not explicitly mentioned** in competitor materials, but:
- Odoo: Shop floor interface redesign (Odoo 19) - separate view for operators
- NetSuite: Role-based training mentioned (receivers, pickers, supervisors)
- Logiwa: Different views implied for 3PL clients vs. warehouse staff

**Insight**: Most competitors don't heavily emphasize role-specific UIs. This is our differentiation opportunity.

### 4. Common Success Metrics
- **Time-to-productivity**: How fast staff become operational (Logiwa: 3-4 hours)
- **Adoption rate**: RF device usage, system engagement (NetSuite: 90% by week 4)
- **Accuracy improvements**: Pick accuracy, inventory accuracy (NetSuite: 99% within 2 months)
- **Operational efficiency**: Dock-to-stock time, throughput (NetSuite: 30% reduction)

## Key Insights for Our UX Redesign

### 1. **Speed Matters Most**
- Logiwa wins on speed: 3-4 hours to train staff
- NetSuite 2025: 30-minute self-service setup
- **Our Target**: < 15 minutes onboarding wizard

### 2. **Phased Rollout Reduces Risk**

- Social proof: If available, show customer logos/testimonials
- Feature highlights: Role-based dashboards, mobile-first, real-time visibility

### Onboarding Wizard (8 Steps)
**Learn from**: Fishbowl (simplicity), NetSuite (phased approach), Odoo (modular)

1. **Company Info** (like Fishbowl step 1)
2. **Department Setup** - Pre-built templates (like Odoo modules)

- Skip non-essential steps (like Odoo's modular approach)
- "Why this matters" context (like Logiwa's strong support)
- Auto-save (modern SaaS standard)

### Role-Based Dashboards
**Learn from**: Odoo (shop floor redesign), NetSuite (role-based training)

**Differentiate by**:
- Executive: Analytics-heavy (not in competitor focus)
- Manager: Oversight + team management (mentioned but not emphasized)
- Operator: Single-job focus (like Odoo 19 shop floor)
- Inventory: Bin/stock focus (standard WMS)
- Sales: CRM-lite (not found in competitors - our addition)

### Drag-and-Drop Role Management
**Learn from**: No competitor found doing this
- **Opportunity**: This is truly innovative
- Inspiration: Notion's permission sharing, Linear's project assignment
